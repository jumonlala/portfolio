# Portfolio Website

I created a static [portfolio website](https://jumonlala.github.io/portfolio/) to showcase my background, resume, projects, and blog, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed the website's structure and incorporated features that allow for easy updates. 

Additionally, I utilized Bootstrap to design and implement dynamic, responsive elements, ensuring a modern user experience across various devices.
